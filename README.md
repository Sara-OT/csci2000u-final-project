Title# The Correlation of student environmental factors to the amont of alcohol consumed

About us Sara Bhatti David Dickson

Introduction

The topic being discussed is how student environmental factors affect the amount of alcohol consumed. This project will look at how the environmental factors can be used to project and predict how much a student partakes in alcoholism. This dataset is from kaggle and is called student alcohol consumption. The data itself was taken from surveys taken but students.

Discussion

One interesting thing about the data given is that it showed that people in school drank more in their teen years then in their young adult years for week days. This showed that the peak drinking age was 16 and that after 16 it gradually became less. For the weekends it was shown that 18 year old drank the most and after that it seemed to decrease, with and increase in drinking on weekends from 15 to 18.

Another discovery found from this study was that both on weekdays and on weekends females drank more than males did as a whole.

It was found that the place where the students lived also affected as to how much that they drank alcohol. Students in urban environments consumed far more alcohol then students living in rural environments.

It was also found that the more stable an income for the students parents regardless of it being the mother or father showed they had more disposable income and as such drank more alcohol.

Students where both parents lived together had more disposable income and as such drank more.

A short coming of this dataset is that there are far more teenagers that were surveyed than people above the age of 20. For example only one 22 year old was sampled.

Conclusion

It was found that students that seemed to have more disposable income from parents or other environmental factors actually drank more then students with less. This can be seen because students where their parents are together consumed more alcohol then students with separated parents. Also the higher an education of the parents for the students the more alcohol that they would drink.

Students in rural areas consumed less than students in urban areas. It was also found the females consume more alcohol than males and the peak drinking range is 16-18 years old.

This data taught us that environmental factos can influence as to how much a student will drink.
